        <h2>Good Memory</h2>
        <p>Imagine you're with a group of friends, at the end of a long, pizza-filled night. The box is almost empty, save for one last slice, sitting there like a small piece of treasure. Everyone's full, but no one wants to be the first to admit they still want it. You stare at the slice for a moment, hoping someone will just take it, but no one does.

            Then, almost like in slow motion, one friend, who's usually the quiet one, reaches out. They grab the slice with a smile, declaring, "I'll take one for the team!" As they take the first bite, everyone else laughs and cheers, relieved that the pizza has been claimed.
            
            That slice, though small, is more than just food. It's the last bit of shared experience‚Äîthe quiet, unspoken bond of friendship over something as simple as pizza.
            
            This kind of memory feels comforting and warm, like the end of a good night.</p>
